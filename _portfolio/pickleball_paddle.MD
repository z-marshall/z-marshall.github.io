Pickleball has taken the country by storm as the new craze due to easy accessibility for all ages and skill levels. The only thing you need is a paddle, a ball, an old tennis court (because who plays that anymore), and some people to play with. Most of these can be found at your local park, but it's always BYOP (bring your own paddle). With any new craze, manufacturers are creating hundreds of varieties of pickleball paddles with various features and buzzwords like "carbon fiber infused" and "lightweight" paddles that increase prices. So what we wanted to understand was what you truly need to have a functioning pickleball paddle. And it was a lot simpler than these manufacturers want you to know with their $40-$400 paddles.

The Pickleball official rules are clear but open-ended on what a "paddle" is. These are the USA Pickleball Official Rulebook 2024 Paddle Specifications. 
 
• 2.E.1. Material. The paddle must be made of any material deemed safe and not prohibited by these rules. The paddle shall be made of rigid, non-compressible material meeting the criteria located on the USA PICKLEBALL website. 
• 2.E.2. Surface. The paddle’s hitting surface shall not contain delamination, holes, cracks, rough textures, or indentations that break the paddle skin or surface, or any objects or features that allow a player to impart excessive spin on the ball. 
• 2.E.3. Size. The combined length and width, including any edge guard and butt cap, shall not exceed 24 inches (60.96 cm). The paddle length cannot exceed 17 inches (43.18 cm). There is no restriction on paddle thickness.

With these in mind, it was time to get to work designing our own paddle. Conventional paddles have a rectangular shape with rounded edges for the paddle surface and a uniform grip that combines with the paddle surface. Since that is standard convention, we decided to maintain the traditional pickleball paddle look for the intial trial of printing paddles. In order to successfully print this paddle on the available 3D filament printers, the paddle was separated into two parts, the paddle surface and the handle. These were printed separately to ensure a smooth paddle surface (as per section 2.E.1 of the USA Pickleball Official Rulebook 2024) and because the length of the pickleball paddle in total was longer than the print bed. The paddle was secured with M4 x 20mm bolts going from the handle into M4 heat-set inserts that were pressed into the paddle surface.

The paddle was 37.5 cm long (from paddle tip to end of handle)  and 18 cm wide to fit regulation. This is a combined 55.5 cm which is well within the maximum 69.96 cm limit. The thickness of 1.4 cm was primarily chosen out of necessity to ensure the heat set inserts were not plastic in too think of surrounding plastic, but also to test why lightweight paddles are advertised so aggressively. After swinging the paddle a few times, a lot of pressure is put on the wrist joint in those motions, making it slightly uncomfortable and possibly a risk of overstraining the wrist with repeated play. While there may be some who would enjoy a heavy paddle, my future iterations will be thinned to decrease the weight of the paddle.
The plastic we printed with was PLA which is a rigid non-compressible material that with sufficient thickness, easily survive a pickleball match. While playtesting is on the horizon, initial thoughts are that the paddle is sufficiently prepared and abides by the pickleball official rules.
