### What is Top Down Modeling? How does one create a top down modelled assembly?
Top-Down modeling is the use of a multicomponent assembly to compartmentalize a complex assembly/design. The advantages of top-down modeling are the ability to build based on other bodies in the design rather than needing to flip through multiple part files and hope everything lines up and fits together. In addition to building based on other bodies and parts, it’s easily organized by component in the timeline.
	
  As mentioned, top-down modeling utilizes the power of components to have multiple differentiable bodies. All sketches, extrusions, and edits must be made under their respective component to be associated. In this example of the bike attachable phone holder, a 3 part component assembly was crafted to allow for easy multiple-material assembly. Top-down modeling allowed for easy organization and modeling using inputted handlebars and iPhone in the design workspace. Dimensions and joints were easily created to understand how large (in the correct scale) these components should be and how they would accurately interact with their real object counterparts. Projections of the iPhone and handlebars in fusion allowed for these proper measurements.


### Design and Material Selections and Assembly Instructions
  This model was created as 4 pieces, connected with bolt/peg connections. The first component is the two handle clamps made of PLA, which are connected with an M5 bolt and nut that can tighten and loosen as needed to secure to a range of handlebar diameters, remaining rigid as it’s tightened. The second section is the stand, where the angle and connection of various parts for easy printing are centered. This was printed separately from the handlebar clamps for easy printing, and connected using a screw to more permanently secure the two pieces together post-printing. The final piece is the phone holding component. This piece was made of 90A TPU to allow it to squeeze around the phone for a grippy yet flexible hold. On the back, is a cross extrusion that fits into the cross cutout on the middle PLA piece. An M3 bolt goes through both the PLA and TPU components to secure them together. This bolt is removable and the holder section can be situated sideways, to give a horizontal phone holding orientation. This bolt only needs hand tightening, so an orientation can be adjusted per trip to best suit the rider's phone/navigation needs. 
This design is simple and easily printable due to top-down modeling and smart component choices. The simplicity of this design makes it ideal for its needs and achieves its goal of a secure and adjustable bike phone holder.
