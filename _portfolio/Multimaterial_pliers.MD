### What is multmaterial extrusion and why use it?
"Description of the project with a blurb about print-in-place parts. Perform external
research to determine other applications print-in-place has been used. What
combination of materials work well for print-in-place?"


### About this design
  "About the design and iterative process (e.g., how was the spring component
created and how is it retained in the model, materials used)"

## Autodesk Fusion 360 Model

### Plier Specifications
Jaw length and capacity, etc. 
  

### Print Settings and Specification
A great aspect of the SuperSlicer gcode creator is the ability to adjust infill densities and geometries in the SuperSlicer platform, rather than having to design it with particular infills and densities in the CAD model itself. This was utilized in this model for the flexible component, as the CAD model was a solid body, but in SuperSlicer, was adapted to have a grid infill of 18% density for best flexibility.
