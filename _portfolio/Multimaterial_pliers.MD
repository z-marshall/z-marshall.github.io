### What is multmaterial extrusion and why use it?
"Description of the project with a blurb about print-in-place parts. Perform external
research to determine other applications print-in-place has been used. What
combination of materials work well for print-in-place?"


### About this design
  "About the design and iterative process (e.g., how was the spring component
created and how is it retained in the model, materials used)"
