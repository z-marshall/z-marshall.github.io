Syringe Pumps are a useful tool when dispensing liquids, especially in regard to accuracy when compared to a human hand. Their reliability and diversity have made them a staple in the medical industry, laboratories, and beyond. While basic applications can be done with a low-priced, one-speed pump with a specialized size syringe, pumps that can be adapted to various sizes and flow rates drastically increase in price when requiring these specifications. The goal of this design was to create an accurate, cost-effective, programmable pump that could effectively be introduced into a medical situation with ease. This includes adaptability to various sizes of syringe pumps and flow rates without the need for tools or alterations to the pump.

## Operation Instructions 
The syringe pump is easy and intuitive to use. Once the Arduino is programmed with its respective flow rate for the operation, the syringe barrel flange is inserted into its respective slot (5mL syringe in the protruding slot closest to the end of the pump, 20 mL syringe in the other slot). The barrel should be pressed down fully into the slot and feel very secure. The carriage is then manually maneuvered (by hand turning the screw) such that the plunger fits in the cutout of the carriage. The motor is plugged in and checked to ensure the syringe is ready for use (the LED should be yellow at this time). The syringe pump can now be started by pressing the on button (the LED will turn green). The pump will dispense a uniform amount of liquid until the syringe is empty, at which point the kill switch will be hit and the pump will stop (the LED will turn red).  At that point, the pump can be turned off and unplugged, and the syringe removed.
