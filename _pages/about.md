## Education

* Vanderbilt University (expected Spring 2025)
  * BE Biomedical Engineering
  * BS Mathematics

## Technical Skills

Zoe has experience with a variety of industry standard softwares, tools, techniques, and processes.

* CAD modeling (Solidworks (CSWA Certification) and Autodesk Fusion 360)
* Soldering and Circuit Building
* Electrical Impedence Testing (Network Anaylser)
* Programming/Coding (Python, MatLab, & LabView)
* Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)

## Work Experience

Zoe has spent the last two summers working an a Research and Development Intern at Provisio Medical. There she performed testing of electrical and mechanical components to determine variability between components and batches for reliability analysis. She made sigificant contrubtuions during a Root Cause Corrective Action investigation of the electrical impedance of critical components throughout the manufacturing process for a company-wide Design Review and report. This resulted in her creation, writing, and implementation of the acceptance criteria of components' electrical characteristics to be used in maufacturing and changes to equipment and assembly techniques during manufacturing.

## Research

Zoe is currently training in proper use of optical equipment which will then be applied to developing optic imaging technologies for diagnostics. Her experiment aims to develop an optical imaging device that delivers timely and accurate data regarding a cave-in of the esophagus for diagnostic use on patients with obstructive sleep apnea and other sudden airway obstruction conditions. The methodology of the novel optical technique that will be applied has been outlined in “Video-rate high-precision time-frequency multiplexed 3D coherent ranging” by Ruobing Qian (1). When applied, this will overcome the lack of 3D frame rate that is evident in current optical technologies and enable circular sampling. She will be responsible for creating such a setup, and ensuring the quality of the device by meeting a drastic decrease in spatial testing time and required image precision.
